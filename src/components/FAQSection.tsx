    question: "What is IncoXchange?",
    answer: "IncoXchange is a work order management platform for property managers. Create work orders with photos, assign to contractors via text, track everything in real time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do contractors need to download an app?",
    answer: "No. They get a text with a link, click it, and they're in. Works on any phone with the internet maybe even flip phones."
  },
  {
    question: "How do work orders get tracked for accounting?",
    answer: "Every job creates a digital paper trail: Timestamped status changes, photos and invoices attached, costs tracked by property/contractor/type, one click export of reports/spreadsheets."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my contractors aren&apos;t tech savvy?",
    answer: "If they can text, they can use IncoXchange. No passwords (login with phone number), no apps, no training."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Finance set spending limits by property?",
    answer: "Yes. Set monthly or per job limits. Get alerts before overages. Require approval for jobs over custom thresholds."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can I pay contractors after job completion?",
    answer: "Contractors submit photos and invoices instantly. You approve from your phone. Digital approval goes straight to accountingâ€”most contractors get paid 2-3 weeks faster."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it integrate with QuickBooks or other accounting software?",
    answer: "Export to CSV/Excel compatible with QuickBooks, NetSuite, and most systems. Full API integrations coming later this year."
  },
  {
    question: "What reports can I pull for tax season?",
    answer: "All maintenance by property, contractor payments (1099 info), expenses by category, photo documentation for insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does IncoXchange cost?",
    answer: "Free, no credit card. $49/month for 6+ properties. Contractors are always free. No setup fees. Cancel anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I try it with just a few properties first?",
    answer: "Yes! Start with 1 property. See how it works. Add the rest in minutes. No minimums."
